<h3>Will I really know how to code after completing a course?</h3>
<p>Not only will you know how to code, but you will have written a programming application in the language of the course you complete.
<br/><br/>
You don’t have to be a genius to code, you just need to be determined. 
</p>
<h3>Do I have to have coding experience to attend one of these courses?</h3>
<p> No coding experience is necessary to attend a course.  However, you do need to be proficient with a computer and show up with a good work ethic.</p>
		
		
<h3>What are the prerequisites for these courses?</h3>
<p>
All of the courses require that you have basic experience using a computer to input text and manipulate graphics.  All courses also require you to have the ability to work productively for 6+ hours/day in a social, experiential learning environment.

<h3>Will students receive a certificate upon completion?</h3>
<p>Much more important than a certificate of completion, students will walk away with their own working application.  As a piece of a developer’s portfolio, this aligns better with the demands of potential employers.</p>

<h3>Will I get a job after completing the course?</h3>
<p>We don’t make any promises that you will get a job, but upon completion of one of our full length courses you will be a proficient programmer in the framework for the class you participated. We have relationships with many software companies in the region who are constantly looking for qualified programmers.  If you are interested in employment upon completion, we will be happy to refer you to relevant job opportunities.</p>

<h3>Am I too [insert demographic] for this course? What if I don't fit the "programmer" stereotype?</h3>
<p>We believe that anyone can learn to code, no matter your age, gender, or favorite basketball team. There is no age requirement at Awesome Inc U. We've seen successful programmers as young as elementary school and several in their 60's. The average age of our students is 27, more than 25% of our students are female, and we've had students travel from places like Nashville and Detroit to participate in our courses.</p>

<h3>I registered for a course, but now I can't attend. Can I get a refund?</h3>
<p>We don't offer refunds for our 1-day Crash Courses, but if something comes up, you may request to transfer your registration to a future course date.</p>

<h3>What if I have more questions? How do I contact someone at Awesome Inc U?</h3>
<p>We're available via email: <a href="mailto:founders@awesomeinc.org?Subject=Awesome%20Inc%20U">founders@awesomeinc.org</a> or you can reach out on Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/awesome_inc">@awesome_inc</a>.</p>
